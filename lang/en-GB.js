    subtitle: `We have been friends who know each other for over 10 years. 
      The cutting edge technologies have always been our main point of 
      interest. The concept of the block chain showed all of us new 
      possibilities and solutions to problems created by the digital 
      age. Inspired by that we decided to be a part of the decentralization 
      movement. The two projects about which we are mostly excited are 
      Cardano and Polkadot. They are the best example of the last 12 
      years of progress which have been made in block chain technologies.
