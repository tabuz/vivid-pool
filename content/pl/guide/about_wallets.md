## Digital wallet

A digital wallet also known as "e-Wallet" is an electronic device, online service, or software program that allows one party to make electronic transactions with another party bartering digital currency units for goods and services. This can include purchasing items on-line with a computer or using a smartphone to purchase something at a store. Money can be deposited in the digital wallet prior to any transactions or, in other cases, an individual's bank account can be linked to the digital wallet.

## Cryptocurrency wallet

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet where private keys are stored for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cardano. In addition to this basic function of storing the keys, a cryptocurrency wallet more often also offers the functionality of encrypting and/or signing information. Signing can for example result in executing a smart contract, a cryptocurrency transaction, identification or legally signing a 'document'.

Daedalus is a full node wallet. This means that unlike light wallets (e.g.Yoroi, Adalite etc.) Daedalus downloads a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently validates every transaction in its history. That way you get maximum security and completely trustless operation, without centrally hosted 3rd party servers.

All major desktop operating systems are supported. Daedalus runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Daedalus is built with web technologies on top of Electron, a battle-proven open-source platform for writing cross-platform desktop applications.
