It feels almost like yesterday when we were celebrating our first block and yet here
comes another one. 

As our pool grows in delegated value of Cardano we are able to verify blocks which contain
more valuable transactions. This block had 11 of them with an estimated total value of 206k â‚³.
We would like to say thank you to all of our delegators who made this one possible. With
growing stake we should see more blocks being assigned for validation in upcoming epochs.

Stay tuned for more updates.
