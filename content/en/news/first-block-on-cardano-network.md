After almost 4 months of waiting we are happy to announce that we successfully verified
our first block on Cardano network. This is very important step on our journey. Although 
confirmed block contained only 3 transactions with total value of 45k â‚³ it feels rewarding
to be able to finally add our tiny piece into decentralisation.

We hope that very soon we will verify our second block. Stay tuned for more updates.
