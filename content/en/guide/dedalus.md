Daedalus is a full node wallet. This means that unlike light wallets (e.g.Yoroi, Adalite etc.) Daedalus downloads a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently validates every transaction in its history. That way you get maximum security and completely trustless operation, without centrally hosted 3rd party servers.

All major desktop operating systems are supported. Daedalus runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Daedalus is built with web technologies on top of Electron, a battle-proven open-source platform for writing cross-platform desktop applications.
