# What is blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable database(ledger) that records transactions. All transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or by using blockchain explorers. 

The idea behind is that every transaction needs to be approved by the majority of network participants before adding into the blockchain.

e.g.
    The blockchain technology made it possible to create a Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The key role plays here blockchain immutability. 
    This feature prevents anyone from amending the total number of circulating bitcoin without approval of the majority of the network participants. 
    Otherwise a central authority would be capable of creating(print) more bitcoins ignoring opinions of all other network participants. 
    Wait a minute is it not what FED is doing, right?
 
e.g.
    Let’s say that half of the country's population “A” thinks that the presidential election has been frauded. 
    In the roots of this diversity lies a lack of trust for governments. This problem can be easily solved by using blockchain technology to create a voting mechanism. 
    As the information saved into the blockchain is immutable, it would prevent any attempts of cheating as the majority have to decide which information is true.

This explanation is quite simplified. For more information you have to do your own investigation.
